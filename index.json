This paper provides input into these discussions by evaluating the efficiency and resilience properties of the leading policy proposals. We develop a conceptual model of a prototype agricultural supply chain, parameterize the model based on results from the empirical literature, and conduct simulations to assess the impacts on resilience and economic welfare of four key policy proposals; (i) intensified antitrust enforcement to improve market competition, (ii) subsidization of entry of additional processing capacity, (iii) prevention of price spikes through anti-price-gouging laws, and (iv) diversification of production and processing across multiple regions. Results show that some of the policies have potential to improve supply-chain resilience, but their impacts depend importantly on the existing market structure, and resilience gains often come at the cost of reduced efficiency and market surplus.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Market Structure and Resilience of Food Supply Chains Under Extreme Events","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ellen Bruno","Jeffrey Hadachek","Nick Hagerty","Katrina Jessoe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1674086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674086400,"objectID":"85269580dbd36a38735a1f2fcdf5f4d2","permalink":"https://jhadachek.github.io/publication/wells/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wells/","section":"publication","summary":"Adaptation actions taken to mitigate climate damages may impose negative externalities on vulnerable populations. We study this in the context of groundwater in California and evaluate the effects of annual fluctuations in weather and surface water supplies on agricultural well construction and access to drinking water. Using the population of geocoded wells, we show that farmers respond to extreme heat and surface water scarcity through agricultural well construction. This mitigating behavior by agricultural users imposes costs, as extreme heat and surface water scarcity reduce local groundwater levels and lead to domestic well failures. Our findings demonstrate that an unintended cost of agricultural groundwater extraction is access to drinking water supplies in disadvantaged communities.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"External Costs of Climate Change Adaptation: Agricultural Wells and Access to Drinking Water","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeffrey Hadachek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651363200,"objectID":"c6a67cd4f3a5859aa1ced01bf6d2f0b1","permalink":"https://jhadachek.github.io/publication/nitrate/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nitrate/","section":"publication","summary":"Nitrate contamination of drinking water is a widespread environmental concern and threatens human health. The magnitude of the environmental health consequences depend on an individuals' ability to avoid exposure. However, there are a number of factors which may undermine one's ability to avoid pollution exposure. This paper studies the heterogeneity in avoidance behavior following Safe Drinking Water Act nitrate violations. I find that consumers spend approximately \\$4.7 million annually on bottled water and soda to avoid nitrate contaminated drinking water. However, consumers in resource-constrained areas exhibit substantially less protective behavior. This lack of averting behavior corresponds with 143 additional infant deaths per year from nitrate contamination relative to areas with less-costly access to safe drinking water. These results underscore both there are substantial costs from nitrate pollution and that these costs are disproportionately distributed to those with less ability to protect themselves.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Costs of Nitrate Pollution in Drinking Water","type":"publication"}]
