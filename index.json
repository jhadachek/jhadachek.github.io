We document one such case: Farmers in California respond to heat and drought by extracting more groundwater, lowering the water table, and harming access to drinking water for nearby residents. Using yearly variation we show that surface water scarcity and heat increase agricultural well construction, groundwater depletion, and domestic well failures, and that well construction accounts for a large share of the latter effects. In our setting, adaptation also exacerbates inequality: Effects on domestic well failures are concentrated in low-income and Latino communities.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"External Costs of Climate Adaptation in Common-Pool Groundwater Resources","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeffrey Hadachek","Pierre Merel","Scott Somerville"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1767312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1767312000,"objectID":"0146dce2f875e6fe12f966b30e00693d","permalink":"https://jhadachek.github.io/publication/nitrate_groundwater/","publishdate":"2026-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nitrate_groundwater/","section":"publication","summary":"Nitrate pollution threatens human health and ecosystems in many regions of the world. Although scientists agree that nitrogen compounds from human activity, notably agriculture, enter the groundwater system, empirical estimates of the impacts of land use on nitrate concentrations in well water are still lacking. We provide evidence of such impacts by combining nitrate concentration measurements from about 6,000 groundwater wells with a data set of remotely sensed land uses for California over the period 2007–2023. Results show that a 10 percentage point increase in the share of land used to grow high-nitrogen crops within 500 meters of a well relative to undeveloped land is associated with a 12% increase in nitrate concentrations, while a 10 percentage point increase in the share of land used for low-intensity urban development is associated with a 10% increase. Local dairy cattle populations also meaningfully contribute to nitrate pollution. However, conditioning on initial nitrate measurements, we find limited evidence that human activity affects nitrate concentrations a decade later.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Land Use and Nitrate Concentrations in Groundwater: Evidence from Groundwater Wells in California.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeffrey Hadachek","Nicole Karwowski","Andrew Stevens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1753228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1753228800,"objectID":"fe95f8c20792785d704392c8995debf4","permalink":"https://jhadachek.github.io/publication/plwg/","publishdate":"2025-07-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/plwg/","section":"publication","summary":"Nonpoint source pollution from agriculture is the leading cause of nutrient pollution in the US. This paper addresses whether localized, farmer-led programs can cost-effectively reduce nonpoint source pollution by increasing the adoption of agricultural conservation practices. We study this in the context of an innovative program in Wisconsin that incentivizes farmers to take collective leadership of improving water quality in their local watersheds. Using a shift-share instrumental variables design, we find that a 10 percentage point increase in farmer participation in these programs leads to a 0.03 mg/L reduction (14\\%) in ambient phosphorus concentrations in local streams and rivers. We also show that this change causes an increase in the adoption of cover crops, conservation tillage, and more diverse crop rotations. Importantly, this localized approach achieves water quality and conservation improvements at a substantially lower cost than existing federal subsidy programs, demonstrating the potential for bottom-up approaches to address nonpoint source pollution in other contexts.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Farmer Led Conservation Programs and Nonpoint Source Pollution Abatement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeffrey Hadachek","Meilin Ma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1751328000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1751328000,"objectID":"4613ad4ff078717788d0ba43eb5e994e","permalink":"https://jhadachek.github.io/publication/riskexternalities/","publishdate":"2025-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/riskexternalities/","section":"publication","summary":"Firms may under- or over-invest in risk management from the social planner's perspective, resulting in a negative externality on other economic agents in the supply chain. The externality of risk management provides justification for policy intervention and is particularly relevant for agrifood supply chains that constantly experience shocks and play a primary role in preventing major social losses from food insecurity. We build a theoretical model to characterize such externalities in US food supply chains where intermediary firms choose the quantity of output and the investment in managing risks. The model allows for flexible market structures and interdependence of risk management among firms. Risk interdependence captures the unique feature of biotic hazards (e.g., animal and plant diseases) in agrifood supply chains, where the effectiveness of a firm's risk management depends on peer firms' behavior. We offer novel insights on the role of risk interdependence in driving the externality in risk management under different market structures. We show that private firms invest less than the socially optimal level under perfect competition, but risk interdependence and market power introduce complex incentives in risk-reducing investment that shape the externality. The critical implications for the social efficiency of policy interventions are demonstrated via simulations based on the model and empirical literature on biotic hazards in agrifood markets.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Risk Management Externalities in Agrifood Supply Chains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeffrey Hadachek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1746057600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1746057600,"objectID":"c6a67cd4f3a5859aa1ced01bf6d2f0b1","permalink":"https://jhadachek.github.io/publication/nitrate/","publishdate":"2025-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nitrate/","section":"publication","summary":"Nitrate contamination of drinking water is a widespread concern and threatens human health.

This paper uses an event-study framework to uncover avoidance behavior and infant mortality outcomes following public notifications required by the Safe Drinking Water Act. Using store-level scanner data, I estimate that consumers spend \\$4.5 million annually on bottled water to avoid nitrate-contaminated drinking water. This protective behavior leads to 20 avoided infant deaths per year or \\$223 million in monetized benefits.

Prompted by several systemic disruptions and the increased likelihood of future shocks, significant attention and public financial investment have been devoted to preparing supply chains to be more able to absorb shocks and more nimbly respond in the future. Food and agricultural supply chains have been particularly scrutinized due to widespread shortages and food price inflation of key staples in recent years. Varied perspectives have emerged about the factors that contribute to the resiliency of food supply chains and the interventions that will be most effective. This article reviews the perspectives on food supply chain resilience generally. Furthermore, we attempt to synthesize the methodologies that have been used to study resilience and offer some guidance for economists studying the topic moving forward.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The Economics of Food Supply Chain Resilience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeffrey Hadachek","Meilin Ma","Richard J.

This paper provides input into these discussions by evaluating the efficiency and resilience properties of the leading policy proposals. We develop a conceptual model of a prototype agricultural supply chain, parameterize the model based on results from the empirical literature, and conduct simulations to assess the impacts on resilience and economic welfare of four key policy proposals; (i) intensified antitrust enforcement to improve market competition, (ii) subsidization of entry of additional processing capacity, (iii) prevention of price spikes through anti-price-gouging laws, and (iv) diversification of production and processing across multiple regions. Results show that some of the policies have potential to improve supply-chain resilience, but their impacts depend importantly on the existing market structure, and resilience gains often come at the cost of reduced efficiency and market surplus.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Market Structure and Resilience of Food Supply Chains Under Extreme Events","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeffrey Hadachek","Tina Saitone","Richard J.

This report examines organic dairy and beef markets, including major feed inputs, to assess the current competitive status of these markets. Specifically, in each market, this report considers factors fundamental to determining whether buyers and sellers can form long-term, mutually beneficial buyer/seller relationships that may limit thin market challenges that might otherwise arise.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Organic Feed Grains and Livestock: Factors That Influence Outcomes in Thinly Traded Markets","type":"publication"}]
