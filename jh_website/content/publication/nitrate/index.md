abstract: Nitrate contamination of drinking water is a widespread and worsening environmental concern. The magnitude of the environmental health consequences depend on an individual's ability to avoid exposure. However, there are a number of factors which may undermine one's ability to avoid pollution exposure. This paper studies the heterogeneity in avoidance behavior following Safe Drinking Water Act nitrate violations. I find that consumers exhibit averting response through both bottled water and sugar sweetened beverages. However, consumers in food deserts show a 31 percent lower response, relative to consumers with supermarket and grocery access, and infant mortality increases by 4 percent in the months after violation in food deserts. These results are informative to the mechanisms through which individuals are persistently exposed to environmental pollution despite the presence of regulation.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper studies the costs of Safe Drinking Water Act nitrate violations through beverage sales and infant health outcomes. I find that consumers exhibit averting response through both bottled water and sugar sweetened beverages. However, consumers in food deserts show a 31 percentage points lower response relative to consumers with supermarket and grocery access, and that these same areas experience heightened infant mortality after violations.
