abstract: Recent extreme events and the disruptions they have caused have made supply-chain resilience a key topic for researchers and policy makers, especially in the food industries. This paper provides a theoretical and simulation framework to assess the resilience and welfare implications of five key policy responses that either are being implemented or are under consideration.  Specifically, we study the ramifications of market power, the entry of additional processing capacity, price gouging laws, diversification of production risk, and holding strategic reserves. We show that, while there are some gains to resilience from these policy measures, the effectiveness of these policies depends heavily on the existing market structure, and resilience gains come at the expense of efficiency.
